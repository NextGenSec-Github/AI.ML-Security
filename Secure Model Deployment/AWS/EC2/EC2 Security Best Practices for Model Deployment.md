# EC2 Security Best Practices for Machine Learning üîíüöÄ

Securing Amazon EC2 instances is crucial when deploying machine learning (ML) workloads to protect sensitive data, ensure compliance, and prevent unauthorized access. This document provides comprehensive security best practices specifically designed for machine learning environments running on Amazon EC2.

## 1. IAM Role Configuration üîê

IAM roles play a vital role in managing access to AWS resources securely. When deploying ML workloads on EC2 instances, follow these best practices:

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign IAM roles with the minimum permissions required for ML tasks, restricting access to only necessary AWS services and resources.
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:PutObject",
          "sagemaker:CreateTrainingJob",
          "sagemaker:CreateEndpoint",
          "sagemaker:CreateModel"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- **Temporary Credentials:** Use IAM roles to grant temporary credentials to EC2 instances, reducing the risk of long-term credential exposure.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement role-based access control to manage permissions based on job responsibilities, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific ML tasks.
