# Hardening EC2 Instances for Model Training 🛡️🔒

Hardening EC2 instances for model training is crucial to ensure the security and integrity of machine learning workflows. This document provides comprehensive guidelines and best practices for securing EC2 instances specifically tailored for model training tasks.

## 1. Operating System (OS) Hardening 🖥️

### Patch Management 🛠️
Regularly applying security patches and updates to the operating system and installed software packages is essential to address known vulnerabilities and strengthen the security posture of EC2 instances.

Example:
```bash
sudo yum update -y

```

## Disable Unnecessary Services 🚫

Disabling unnecessary services and daemons reduces the attack surface of EC2 instances, minimizing potential security risks and enhancing overall system security.

Example:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop service_name
sudo systemctl disable service_name
```

## 2. Network Security 🌐

## Firewall Configuration 🛡️
Configuring firewall rules helps control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances, allowing only necessary ports and protocols for model training tasks.

Example:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=22/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
