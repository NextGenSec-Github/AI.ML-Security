# Secure Data Preprocessing on EC2 🛡️🔒

Securing data preprocessing workflows on Amazon EC2 instances is essential to maintain data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This document provides comprehensive guidelines and best practices for securing data preprocessing tasks in machine learning environments.

## 1. Encryption of Raw Data

Encrypting raw data stored on EC2 instances helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or interception.

### a. Encryption at Rest 📦

Utilize AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt raw data stored on Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes attached to EC2 instances. Encrypting data at rest ensures that even if the underlying storage is compromised, the data remains protected.

#### Key Management with AWS KMS

AWS KMS allows you to create and manage cryptographic keys to control access to your data. Use AWS KMS to create a Customer Master Key (CMK) and encrypt EBS volumes with it.

Example Encryption:
```bash
aws ec2 create-volume --size 100 --availability-zone us-east-1a --encrypted --kms-key-id your-kms-key-id
