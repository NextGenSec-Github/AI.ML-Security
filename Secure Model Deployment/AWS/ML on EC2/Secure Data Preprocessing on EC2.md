# Secure Data Preprocessing on EC2 üõ°Ô∏èüîí

Securing data preprocessing workflows on Amazon EC2 instances is essential to maintain data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This document provides comprehensive guidelines and best practices for securing data preprocessing tasks in machine learning environments.

## 1. Encryption of Raw Data

Encrypting raw data stored on EC2 instances helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or interception.

### Encryption at Rest üì¶

Utilize AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt raw data stored on Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes attached to EC2 instances. Encrypting data at rest ensures that even if the underlying storage is compromised, the data remains protected.

#### Key Management with AWS KMS

AWS KMS allows you to create and manage cryptographic keys to control access to your data. Use AWS KMS to create a Customer Master Key (CMK) and encrypt EBS volumes with it.

Example Encryption:
```bash
aws ec2 create-volume --size 100 --availability-zone us-east-1a --encrypted --kms-key-id your-kms-key-id
```

### Encryption in Transit üì°
Implement secure data transfer protocols such as HTTPS or SFTP when transferring raw data to and from EC2 instances. Encryption in transit ensures that data remains protected while in transit over the network.

#### Secure File Transfer with SFTP
Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) provides encrypted data transfer between client and server. Use SFTP for secure file uploads and downloads to EC2 instances.

Example SFTP Transfer:
```bash
sftp -i your_private_key.pem user@your_ec2_instance:/path/to/destination
```

## 2. Access Controls
Implement access controls to restrict access to raw data and preprocessing scripts on EC2 instances.

### IAM Role Configuration üé≠
Assign IAM roles to EC2 instances with the minimum permissions required for data preprocessing tasks, limiting access to only authorized users and resources. IAM roles provide temporary credentials with restricted access, enhancing security.

#### Fine-Grained Access Control with IAM Policies
Craft IAM policies to grant EC2 instances access to specific AWS resources, such as S3 buckets or KMS keys, based on the principle of least privilege.

Example IAM Policy:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
