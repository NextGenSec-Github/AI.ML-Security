# Vulnerability: Search for Victim's Publicly Available Research Materials in Pre-Print Repositories üìöüîç

## Summary

Adversaries can exploit pre-print repositories, such as arXiv, which house the latest academic research papers that haven't undergone peer review. These repositories often include research notes and technical reports that may not be found in traditional journals or conference proceedings. Additionally, pre-print repositories serve as a centralized platform for sharing papers that have been accepted by journals.

This vulnerability allows adversaries to gain a relatively up-to-date view of the research activities within the victim organization. By searching these repositories, adversaries can identify ongoing projects, research directions, and potential vulnerabilities in the organization's machine learning landscape.

## Mitigation

1. **Control Access:** Restrict access to sensitive research papers in pre-print repositories to authorized individuals.

2. **Implement Review Policies:** Establish policies for reviewing and approving the publication of research papers to ensure they align with security guidelines.

3. **Monitor Repository Activity:** Regularly monitor activity on pre-print repositories to identify and respond to any unauthorized access or data extraction attempts.

4. **Encourage Responsible Sharing:** Educate researchers on responsible sharing and the potential security risks associated with exposing detailed research information in pre-print repositories.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, organizations can better safeguard their ongoing research activities from potential exploitation by adversaries.
