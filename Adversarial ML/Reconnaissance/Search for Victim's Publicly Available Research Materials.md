# Vulnerability: Search for Victim's Publicly Available Research Materials ðŸ“š

## Description

Adversaries may exploit publicly available research materials to understand the usage and implementation of machine learning (ML) within a victim organization. By mining information from academic papers, conference proceedings, pre-print repositories, and technical blogs, adversaries can gain insights into the organization's ML landscape. This knowledge empowers them to identify potential targets for attacks or customize existing attacks for greater effectiveness.

Organizations often deploy open source model architectures in production, which may be trained on a combination of publicly available and proprietary data. Understanding the underlying architecture enables adversaries to create more realistic proxy models, further complicating detection efforts.

## Example Scenario

### 1. Identifying Targets

Adversaries can use information from publicly available research materials to identify key individuals or departments involved in ML research within the victim organization. This targeted approach increases the likelihood of successful attacks.

### 2. Creating Proxy ML Models

Armed with knowledge about the organization's model architectures, adversaries can create proxy ML models that mimic the behavior of deployed models. This facilitates the evasion of traditional detection mechanisms.

## Mitigation

1. **Limit Public Exposure:** Restrict access to sensitive research materials and publications that disclose details about your ML infrastructure.

2. **Implement Access Controls:** Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to critical information related to ML models and architectures.

3. **Educate Personnel:** Train employees to be cautious about the information shared in public forums and publications, emphasizing the potential security implications.

4. **Monitor Publicly Available Information:** Regularly monitor open-source repositories, journals, and technical blogs for any unintended disclosures regarding your organization's ML infrastructure.

Remember that the examples provided are for illustrative purposes, and actual implementations may vary based on the specific details of your organization's ML environment.
