# Identifying Assets
In this section, we identify the assets associated with the machine learning (ML) model. Assets encompass various components, data, and resources that are essential for the functioning and integrity of the ML system. Understanding and prioritizing these assets are crucial for effective threat modeling.

### Training Data

- The training data used to train the ML model is a critical asset. It includes:
  - Raw data samples used for model training.
  - Data features, attributes, or variables utilized by the model.
  - Data labeling or annotation provided for supervised learning tasks.
- Assess the quality, diversity, and representativeness of the training data.
- Consider the sensitivity and privacy implications of the training data, especially if it contains personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive business data.

### Model Parameters and Artifacts

- The model parameters, weights, and configurations learned during the training process are valuable assets. These include:
  - Model architecture specifications (e.g., neural network layers, hyperparameters).
  - Trained weights and biases associated with the model's connections and nodes.
  - Serialized model files or artifacts used for inference.
- Evaluate the confidentiality and integrity of model parameters, as unauthorized access or tampering could compromise the model's performance and security.

### Predictions and Outputs

- The predictions generated by the ML model during inference are assets that impact decision-making and downstream processes. These include:
  - Predicted outcomes, classifications, or regression values produced by the model.
  - Confidence scores or probability estimates associated with each prediction.
  - Aggregated metrics or insights derived from analyzing model predictions.
- Consider the potential impact of incorrect or biased predictions on users, stakeholders, and business operations.

### Model Evaluation Metrics

- The performance metrics used to evaluate the ML model's effectiveness are essential assets for assessing its reliability and accuracy. These include:
  - Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, etc.
  - Confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, and other visualizations used to analyze model performance.
  - Benchmarking results comparing the model's performance against baseline or competing models.
- Evaluate the confidentiality and integrity of evaluation metrics, as inaccurate or manipulated metrics could misrepresent the model's performance.

### Development and Deployment Environments

- The development and deployment environments where the ML model is built, tested, and deployed are critical assets. These include:
  - Development tools, libraries, and frameworks used for model development.
  - Testing infrastructure, including datasets, unit tests, and integration tests.
  - Production servers, cloud services, or edge devices hosting the deployed model.
- Assess the security controls, access permissions, and monitoring mechanisms in place to safeguard these environments from unauthorized access or malicious activities.

### Documentation and Intellectual Property

- Documentation, code repositories, and intellectual property associated with the ML model are valuable assets for understanding, reproducing, and maintaining the model. These include:
  - Model documentation, including architecture diagrams, README files, and usage instructions.
  - Source code repositories, version control history, and issue tracking systems.
  - Intellectual property rights, patents, or proprietary algorithms developed as part of the ML model.

- Protect the confidentiality and integrity of documentation and intellectual property to prevent unauthorized disclosure or misuse of sensitive information.

In this section, we identified the assets associated with the machine learning (ML) model, including training data, model parameters, predictions, evaluation metrics, development/deployment environments, and documentation. Understanding these assets' importance and sensitivity is essential for conducting thorough threat modeling in the subsequent sections.
