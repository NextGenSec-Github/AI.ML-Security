# Threat Enumeration
In this section, we enumerate potential threats to the machine learning (ML) model, considering the assets identified in the previous section. Understanding these threats helps in identifying vulnerabilities and assessing the risks associated with the ML system.


## 1. Data Poisoning:

- **Threat:** Malicious actors may inject poisoned data into the training dataset to manipulate the model's behavior.
- **Impact:** Data poisoning can lead to biased model outcomes, reduced accuracy, or compromised model integrity.
- **Likelihood:** Moderate to high, especially in collaborative or open data environments where data quality and provenance may not be well-controlled.
- **Mitigation:** Implement data validation and sanitization techniques to detect and remove anomalous or malicious data points. Employ data provenance tracking and model robustness testing to identify and mitigate data poisoning attacks.


## 2. Adversarial Attacks:

- **Threat:** Adversaries may craft adversarial examples to deceive the ML model into making incorrect predictions.
- **Impact:** Adversarial attacks can lead to misclassification, evasion of detection mechanisms, or exploitation of vulnerabilities in the model's decision boundary.
- **Likelihood:** Moderate to high, as adversarial attacks are well-documented and increasingly prevalent in ML systems.
- **Mitigation:** Apply adversarial robustness techniques such as adversarial training, input preprocessing, and model regularization to enhance the model's resilience against adversarial attacks. Employ defensive mechanisms such as input perturbation or ensemble methods to detect and mitigate adversarial examples during inference.

## 3. Model Inversion:

- **Threat:** Attackers may attempt to reverse-engineer sensitive information from the ML model's outputs, such as inferring training data or extracting confidential features.
- **Impact:** Model inversion attacks can compromise data privacy, confidentiality, and intellectual property rights.
- **Likelihood:** Moderate, depending on the availability of model outputs and attacker capabilities.
- **Mitigation:** Apply differential privacy techniques, input/output perturbation, or model output sanitization to mitigate the risk of model inversion attacks. Limit access to sensitive model outputs and implement access controls to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information.

## 4. Model Stealing:

- **Threat:** Malicious actors may attempt to steal or replicate the ML model's architecture, parameters, or predictions for unauthorized use or exploitation.
- **Impact:** Model stealing can lead to intellectual property theft, revenue loss, or misuse of proprietary algorithms.
- **Likelihood:** Moderate to high, particularly for models deployed in public or shared environments where source code or model artifacts may be accessible.
- **Mitigation:** Implement model watermarking, obfuscation, or encryption techniques to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the ML model. Monitor for unauthorized access or suspicious behavior indicating potential model theft and enforce strict access controls to restrict access to model artifacts.

## 5. Data Leakage:

- **Threat:** Data leakage occurs when sensitive information from the training data is inadvertently exposed or incorporated into the ML model, leading to privacy violations or unintended consequences.
- **Impact:** Data leakage can compromise user privacy, violate regulatory compliance requirements, or introduce biases into the model's predictions.
- **Likelihood:** Moderate, depending on the thoroughness of data preprocessing and feature selection procedures.
- **Mitigation:** Implement data anonymization, de-identification, or differential privacy techniques to prevent the inadvertent leakage of sensitive information. Conduct rigorous data privacy impact assessments and adhere to privacy-preserving practices throughout the ML model lifecycle.

## 6. Model Drift and Degradation:

- **Threat:** ML models may experience drift or degradation in performance over time due to changes in the underlying data distribution, environmental factors, or model decay.
- **Impact:** Model drift and degradation can lead to inaccurate predictions, decreased user trust, or operational inefficiencies.
- **Likelihood:** High, particularly for models deployed in dynamic or evolving environments where data characteristics may change over time.
- **Mitigation:** Implement continuous monitoring and model retraining pipelines to detect and adapt to changes in data distribution or performance metrics. Establish feedback loops for collecting user feedback and incorporating domain expertise to address model drift and degradation effectively.
