# Threat Enumeration
In this section, we enumerate potential threats to the machine learning (ML) model, considering the assets identified in the previous section. Understanding these threats helps in identifying vulnerabilities and assessing the risks associated with the ML system.


## 1. Data Poisoning:

- **Threat:** Malicious actors may inject poisoned data into the training dataset to manipulate the model's behavior.
- **Impact:** Data poisoning can lead to biased model outcomes, reduced accuracy, or compromised model integrity.
- **Likelihood:** Moderate to high, especially in collaborative or open data environments where data quality and provenance may not be well-controlled.
- **Mitigation:** Implement data validation and sanitization techniques to detect and remove anomalous or malicious data points. Employ data provenance tracking and model robustness testing to identify and mitigate data poisoning attacks.
