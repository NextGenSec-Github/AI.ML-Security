# Understanding Threat Modeling
Threat modeling is a structured approach to identifying, evaluating, and mitigating potential security threats to a system. When applied to machine learning (ML) models, threat modeling helps in understanding the various vulnerabilities and risks associated with the model's development, deployment, and usage.

## What is Threat Modeling?
Threat modeling involves systematically identifying potential threats, determining their potential impact, and devising strategies to mitigate them. It helps in proactively addressing security concerns rather than reacting to them after an incident occurs. In the context of ML models, threat modeling is crucial due to the sensitivity of data, potential biases, and susceptibility to adversarial attacks.
