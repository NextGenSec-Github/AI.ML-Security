# Homomorphic Encryption on ML Facial Recognition

In this project, we implement homomorphic facial recognition using the TanSeal and DeepFace libraries. The goal is to encrypt facial embeddings using homomorphic encryption and store them in a cloud system. Despite the cloud system not having access to the secret key, it can still perform calculations, such as finding the Euclidean distance between two encrypted vectors.

## Requirements

Make sure to install the TenSeal and required Libraries:
